#### How it helps you
- Cut down on front-end development time.
- Enhance your application performance due to smaller file sizes.
- Keep coding in your favorite code editor, without having to constantly upload anything to APEX or a web server.
- Stop manual refresh of your browser to get `js` and `css` modification.
- Stop affecting other developers. **Any development done within APEX Nitro affects you and only you**.
- Be notified of `js` and `css` errors as you save.

#### Other benefits
- Makes responsive development easier by synchronizing multiple devices together.
- All devices (desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.) will imitate each others actions (scrolling, clicking, typing).
- Eliminates the need for refreshing the browser. As soon as you save your code in the text editor, you get automatic code injection / reloading in the browser.
