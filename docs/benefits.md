# APEX Nitro Additional Benefits
Technicalities aside, here are a few benefits of using APEX Nitro for your business.

### Reduce Development Time
With the real-time synchronization, you get to see your CSS and JavaScript change instantaneously. Customarily, a developer would make JavaScript or CSS changes directly in APEX. After saving the changes, the developer would then run the page again. That task can be repeated hundreds of times per day. 

APEX Nitro reduces the development time by eliminating that back and forth between the code editor and the end result.

### Reduce Mundane Tasks
With automatic file upload, we no longer have to manually upload static files to APEX Shared Components or a web server, allowing us to concentrate on what’s really important: the code.

The process of uploading files to APEX is repetitive and time consuming. APEX Nitro takes that out of the way.

### Increase Maintainability
By eliminating code scattering across an APEX application. With every line of code accessible locally, there is no need make dozens of clicks through the APEX search to get to what we are looking for.

The idea is to centralize all front-end related code to a single entry point. Having your favorite code editor pointing to that source folder makes editing painless.

### Better Modularization
Oracle developers tend to modularize part of PL/SQL code into packages. Front-end code deserves the same kind of treatment. APEX Nitro allows us to create a logical file structure for any CSS or JavaScript code. Example: header.css, body.css, footer.css.

Because APEX Nitro has concatenation options, the end result can be a single file containing all your code. Modularizing your source code is beneficial for cost and for maintenance.

### Performance Boost
With APEX Nitro automatically generating a minified and concatenated version of CSS and JavaScript files, the smaller file sizes will result in better performance at page load time.

Depending on the compression ratio you achieve, it means less kilobytes to download for your users.

### Enhances Teamwork
By isolating code to a local system, a developer's code no longer breaks a teammate’s environment during development.

When a developer considers the code to be ready and stable, APEX Nitro can publish these files to the APEX main server and only at that time will the other teammates benefit from the new changes.

### Makes Responsive Development Easier
By synchronizing multiple devices together. All devices (desktop, tablet, mobile, etc.) will simultaneously react (scrolling, clicking, typing) to one another.

This reduces the errors found during QA due to the lack of testing. If something isn't right on mobile, you will see it right away.
