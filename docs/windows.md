# Windows

A dependency of APEX Nitro (browsersync) requires C++ runtime libraries.

You might run into issues when installing on Windows if you don't have them.

**As far as we've tested, these are just warnings and do not affect APEX Nitro.**

As instructed by [Browsersync](https://www.browsersync.io/docs/#windows-users):

> The way to resolve this is to install Visual Studio. At the time of this writing (Feb 2015) the compilation works fine with Visual Studio 2013 Update 4.
> After installation of Visual Studio npm should not throw errors any longer, but only issue warnings.

**Feel free to install Visual Studio or not.** If you do, these errors/warnings will disappear.
