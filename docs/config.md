# APEX Nitro Configuration

For APEX Nitro to connect and synchronize local static files to your APEX application, it needs configuration for a few parameters (e.g. Application URL, Absolute Path to local directory, etc.).

Execute this command to configure an APEX Nitro project:

apex-nitro config <project>
```

A new browser tab will open and you can simply fill the form:
