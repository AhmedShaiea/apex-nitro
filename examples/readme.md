# Examples

To help you become familiar with APEX Nitro we have added a few different examples. Each subfolder here contains a unique APEX Nitro demo and configuration settings.

#### Setup
1. Run `apex-nitro config`
2. Use the `import` feature and chose the `json` file at the root of any example folder.
3. Replace all `CHANGE_ME` occurrences with your local file path to the desired example.
4. Run `apex-nitro launch <demo name>`
