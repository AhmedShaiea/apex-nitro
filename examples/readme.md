# Examples
To help you become familiar with APEX Nitro we have added a few examples. Each subfolder here contains a unique APEX Nitro demo along with a configuration export file.

### How to try the examples
1. Run `apex-nitro config`
2. Use the `import` feature and chose the `json` file at the root of any example folder.
